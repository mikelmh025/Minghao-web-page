**Looking for full time position**

I am a last-year Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. candidate at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/), fortunately advised by Prof. [James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/)! 


My research interests lie in applying machine learning to computer vision tasks, particularly focusing on complementary teaming between human and artificial intelligence. I am experienced in **improving** generative models, including diffusion models, GANs, and VAEs. I have also **worked** on automatic dataset collection. Additionally, my expertise extends to **applications** of label noise learning, label noise detection, object detection, image segmentation, and image super-resolution models.


Previously, I received my Computer Science Master degree and Computer Science B.S degree in [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/)
