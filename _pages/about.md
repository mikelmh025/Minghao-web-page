I am currently an Advanced AI Research Scientist Manager at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/), where I focus on Generative AI and AI agent tools. I completed my Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/), where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/) [[UCSC VIS Group](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/vis/)].

My research interests lie in applying machine learning to computer vision tasks, with expertise in Generative AI, Human-AI teaming, and Auto Dataset Collection. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications, particularly in the development and deployment of AI systems that enhance human capabilities.

Previously, I received my Computer Science Master degree and Computer Science B.S degree from [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/).
