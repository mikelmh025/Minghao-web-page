I am a third-year Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. candidate at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/), fortunately advised by Prof. [James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/)! 

My research interests lie in applying machine learning to computer vision tasks, particularly seeking complementary teaming between human and artificial intelligence. I also have interests in generative adversarial networks and autoencoder networks on computer vision applicaitons.


Previously, I received my Computer Science Master degree and Computer Science B.S degree in [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/)
